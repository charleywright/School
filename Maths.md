##### Sketching graphs of derived functions
* **The derivative is the gradient of the graph.** If the gradient is positive so must that point on the derivative (even if the point on the original graph has `y < 0`)
* (See below) The gradient decreases as the gradient decreases, then increases as the gradient increases
```desmos-graph
left=-40; right=40; top=400; bottom=-400;

f(x)=x^3+12x^2+50x-11
f(x)=3x^2+24x+50
```

##### Trig Equations
**The simple ones**
$$\sqrt(2)*cos(x)+1=0$$
$$cos(x)=\frac{-1}{\sqrt(2)}$$
$$x=\frac{3\pi}{4}, x=\frac{5\pi}{4}$$
