## Mumbai Traffic
#### Challenges
* Two highways into the CBD
* 20 million people
* 1.8 million cars, many old and inefficient
* increasing by 200 cars per day as people earn more
* trains at 2.5X capacity
* 11 million people use public transport
* 16km/h average speed (pollution)
* $500 million lost per year in productivity and fuel
* 63 million traffic violations in 2021, 50 million in 2020 & 2019
* narrow roads, no drainage, heavy rain, poor maintenance

#### Solutions
*  MonoRail
	* Faster than cars or busses
	* Tight corners or steep terrain is not a problem
	* Easy to implement
	* Caters well to crowded and narrow areas such as the East of the city
	* Improves connectivity between railway lines
	* Only 360 passengers per train

## Glaciation
#### Corrie (Corrie an Lochan, Cairngorms)
* Most commonly on North/Noth-East facing slopes as more shade allows snow to build up faster
* Snow falls, compacting and pushing air out, forming ice (neve)
* Weight of the ice causes it to begin to slowly move downhill and rotate, called Rotational Slip
* Some ice may melt due to friction, producting meltwater which acts as a lubricant
* Water may enter cracks and freeze, attaching rock to the ice. Ice moves, ripping the rock away
* Rock in the ice (potentially from plucking) scrapes against the hillside, eroding it. This is abrasion
* The ice may slip away from the back wall, creating a crevasse
* After the ice melts freeze thaw (water entering cracks, freezing, exherting pressure on rock, repeating until rock breaks) can cause the walls of the corrie to steepen
* Water may fill the hollow created forming a Tarn
* The rocks from the corrie may roll down the hillside and become part of a glacier, aiding with abrasion

#### Arete (Carn Mor Dearg)
* **Most marks are from corrie formation**
* Two corries form back to back, producing an arete
* Back walls of corries may erode further, decreasing the width of the arete and making it more jagged
* Freeze-thaw may occur on the arete, making it further jagged

#### Pyramidal Peak (Angel Peak, Cairngorms)
* **Most marks are from corrie/arete formation**
* Three or more corries erode back to back around a mountain top
* Arete's formed by corries rise to a pyramidal peak
* Sharpened by freeze-thaw, further increasing it's steepness

#### U-Shaped Valley (Lairig Ghru, Cairngorms)
* Formed where V-shaped valley is
* More commonly on North/North-East facing slope (less sunlight allows snow to accumulate faster)
* Snow compacts, pushing out air and forming ice
* Gets too heavy, gravity causes movement downhill
* Plucking may occur (water freezing around rocks, attaching them to glacier, glacier rips them out) steepening walls of valley
* Abrasion may occur (rocks in glacier - potentially from plucking - scrape against floor) deepening and widening valley
* Follows existing v-shaped valley, interlocking spurs may be cut off forming truncated spurs & steep valley sides
* Glacier loses power due to increasing temperatures due to altitude or surrounding area
* Some material is discarded and some ice melts to allow the glacier to continue
* Glacier comes to a stop, if pushing material a terminal moraine may be formed
* Ribbon lock may form behind terminal moraine as it acts like a natural barrier/dam
* Misift stream may form (small stream down valley floor)
* Freeze-thaw (water entering cracks, freezing, exherting pressure on rock repeatedly eventually causing it to break) could continue to erode sides, making them rougher and producting scree

#### Hanging Valley
* **Most marks are from u-shaped valley**
* Tributary streams/valleys have much less power therefore don't erode as deep
* After glacier retreats, tributary streams form waterfalls where they enter main valley

#### Truncated Spurs (TODO: Need more info)
* **Most marks are again from u-shaped valley**

#### Ribbon Loch (Loch Avon, Cairngorms)
* **Most marks are yet again from u-shaped valley**
