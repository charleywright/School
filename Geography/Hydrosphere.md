## Rivers
#### Erosion (Common between all)
**Hydraulic Action** - abc
**Abrasion** - def
**Solution** - ghi

#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* Steep slopes in the upper course give the river a lot of energy
* The river erodes due to hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN).
* The valley sides are exposed to weatrhering such as freeze-thaw and biological weathering
* Material from weathering rolls down the valley sides into the river due to gravity
* It is carried by the river downstream as bedload, aiding the process of abrasion

#### Formation of waterfall
* Formed when a river flows over bands of soft and hard rock
* Softer, less resistant rock is eroded faster by the processes of hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN)
* The river undercuts the hard rock, creating an unsupported overhang
* The river continues to erode below the overhand, cutting further inward and deepening the river in that area, creating a plunge pool
* The unsupported overhang eventually collapses into the plung pool where it is broken up and used in abrasion for further erosion
* Some rock will continue downstream as bedload
* This cycle continues, with the waterfall slowly cutting upstream, forming a gor

#### Formation of meander


#### Formation of ox-bow lake
