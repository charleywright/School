## Rivers
#### Erosion (Common between all)
**Hydraulic Action** - Water forces air into cracks in the rock which exherts pressure on the rock, causing it to crack and break away. The physical force of the water alone can also be enough to weaken and break away rock
**Abrasion** - Rock in the water hits and grinds against the banks/riverbed, acting like sandpaper to erode the rock
**Solution** - Water dissolves some of the minerals in rocks, weathering them

#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* Steep slopes in the upper course give the river a lot of energy
* The river erodes due to hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN).
* The valley sides are exposed to weatrhering such as freeze-thaw and biological weathering
* Material from weathering rolls down the valley sides into the river due to gravity
* It is carried by the river downstream as bedload, aiding the process of abrasion

#### Formation of waterfall
* Formed when a river flows over bands of soft and hard rock
* Softer, less resistant rock is eroded faster by the processes of hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN)
* The river undercuts the hard rock, creating an unsupported overhang
* The river continues to erode below the overhand, cutting further inward and deepening the river in that area, creating a plunge pool
* The unsupported overhang eventually collapses into the plung pool where it is broken up and used in abrasion for further erosion
* Some rock will continue downstream as bedload
* This cycle continues, with the waterfall slowly moving upstream, cutting a gorge into the landscape

#### Formation of meander
* Formed where rivers lose power and begin eroding laterally in the middle course
* They do this through abtrasion and hydraulic action
* Erosion is greatest on the outide of the river bends as this is where the flow of water is the fastest
* As water hits the outside of the bend it is forced under and along the riverbed to the opposite side of the river. This forms a spiral and is called helicoidal flow
* This causes a steep river cliff to form on the outside of the bend and a river beach on the inside
* The river beach is made up of materials that the river has been carrying that have been deposited due to the inside of a bend having much slower flow rate and less energy

#### Formation of ox-bow lake
* Ox-bow lakes form in the lower course of a river where flood plain sediment is reworked through lateral erosion, where a meander already exists.
* Erosive processes include hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN)
* Maximum erosion takes place on the outside of river bends as this is where water is flowing the fastest
* As the outside of river bends continue to erode, the "neck" narrows over time
* Eventually (commonly during a flood due to the increased flow rate and energy of the river) the river breaks through the neck, forming a more direct route.
* Eddies form at the entrance and exit of the old meander, which slow the flow of water causing it to deposit sediment.
* The entrance and exit eventually become clogged with sediment, sealing them off from the river and it's new path, forming a horse shoe shaped bog or lake

## Global Hydrological cycle
![Global Hydrological Cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleywright/School/master/Geography/Global%20Hydrological%20Cycle.png)
* Closed system (water remains in the system)
1. Evaporation from ocean caused by the sun creates vapour
	* Could also be from evaporation & transpiration (water evaporating from surface of freen leaves)
3. Vapour rises and cools, condensing into couds. Clouds move inland due to wind (advection)
4. Cloud droplets combine and enlarge (often when forced upwards over a mountain) and precipitate in the form of snow or rain
5. Some may be intercepted by plants and trees where it will remain on leaves until evaporating or falling to the ground
6. Water may return in 3 different ways
	* Travel on the surface as overland flow
	* Infiltrate and travel through soil as throughflow
	* Percolate into the bedrock and travel as groundwater flow

## Drainage basin system
##### Inputs
The main input is precipitation mainly in the form of rainfall and snow. The type, strength, length and rate of occurence all have an impact on the amount of water in the system

##### Storage
Storage is when moisture is kept in the system. This can be found in the soil, in lochs, ice caps, glaciers, and on the leaves and roots of vegetation. Water seeps into the ground by the process of infiltration (through soil) and percolation (through rock) and is stored in the soil or in rock stores such as the water table

##### Transfers
Transfers are the movement of water through the system, in the air through clouds and precipitation and on the ground through run-off, infiltration and groundwater flow. Overland flow transfers water through the basin as sheet wash and across the surface in rivers. Throughflow is the flow of water through soil towards a river or the ocean. Groundwater flow is very slow and takes time to flow through the system into rivers

##### Outputs
An output is the moisture which leaves the system by processes such as evaporation, transpiration and flowing into the ocean

##### Model Answer
* Open system (water enters and leaves the system at various points)
1. Water enters through precipitation
2. Some may be intercepted where it falls to the ground as leaf drip or stem flow while some is evaporated (transpiration)
3. Some may be stored on the ground in lakes or snow fields (surface storage)
4. Water may return through any of the main outputs
	* Travel on the surface as overland flow
	* infiltrate and travel through the soil as throughflow
	* Percolate into the bedrock and travel as groundwater flow
5. Some water will be evaporated from storage or while travelling in rivers

## Hydrographs
The main things to comment on are
* Precipitation
* Lag Time
* Rising limb
* Falling limb
* Peak flow
In some cases base flow can be compared to storm flow if it is shown

**Overland flow vs Surface flow**
* Overland flow normally means water flowing across fields/land (flooding)
* Surface flow normally means water flowing in predefined channels on the surface (rivers, streams etc)

These two terms are commonly interchanged however AFAIK there is no penalization for using the wrong one as long as it is clear

Rising limb shape depends on
* **Strength of rainfall**: Stronger rain gives less time for soil to soak up water therefore more surface flow occurs
* **Length of rainfall**: The longer rain continues the more storage will be used and waterlogged soils will become, therefore over time more surface flow will occur
* **Condition of the soil**: If the soil is already waterlogged little water will infiltrate and lots of surface flow will occur
* **Shape of the drainage basin**: If the drainage basin is circular with most tributaries leading to one concentrated place in a wide river the rising limb will be steep because all the water is going to one place compared to if tributaries are spaced out along a thin straight river. The thin river will flow faster, moving runoff quicker

Lag time depends on (surface flow)
* **Condition of the soil**: If the soil is waterlogged a lot of surface flow will occur leading to a shorter lag time
* **Intensity of rain**: More intense rain allows less time for infiltration to occur therefore more surface runoff and a shorter lag time
* **Angle of slopes**: Gentler slopes allow water to flow slower, giving it more time to soak into the soil, increasing the lag time
* **Size of the drainage basin**: In a smaller drainage with less tributaries water will reach the river quicker, decreasing the lag time. In a larger drainage basin the many tributaries will act like temporary storage for the water, increasing the lag time

Falling limb shape depends on
* **Groundwater flow**: If there is a lot of consistent groundwater flow the falling limb will be  slower and more gentle as more water is consistently added
* **High/low tide**: At high tide there is less space for the water to go therefore the falling limb is slower and more gentle

###### More to consider
* **Snowfall**: Less runoff initially but a quick increase in temperature can result in quick thaw and flooding (especially if the ground is frozen)
* **Average Temperature**: Very cold, hot, or dry climates result in hard ground thus more overland flow, shorter lag time, steeper rising limb and higher peak discharge. Higher temperatures could also indicate more evaporation and transpiration
* **Season/Time of the year**: In summer similar amounts of rainfall may not lead to flooding because the soil is ready to accept a lot of water whereas in winter it is already waterlogged. More water is used in summer and the higher temperatures and longer days allow more evaporation and transpiration to occur
* **Urbanisation**: Most man-made things are impermeable (roads, roofing) and have drainage systems (gutters, underground drainage) which cause water to flow very quickly to rivers, causing a short lag time, increased peak discharge and steeper rising limb
* **Drainage systems**: Similar to urbanisation, if farmers dig drainage trenches in their land water will flow much faster and less infiltration will occur therefore a shorter lag time, higher peak discharge and steeper rising limb could be expected
* **Inappropriate farming**: Ploughing on wet soil compresses the subsoil creating a "plough plan" with can decrease water holding capacity and increase overland flow
