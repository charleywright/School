## Rivers
#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* River flows downhill quickly with lots of energy and erodes the landscape vertically due to steep slopes
* The river cuts a deep gash into the landscape using hydraulic action, abrasion and corrosion.
* As the river erodes, the walls are exposed to freeze-thaw weathering, which loosens rocks and causes them to fall into the river. This helps steepen valley sides.
* The fallen rocks help with abrasion, further eroding the ds

#### Formation of waterfall


#### Formation of meander


#### Formation of ox-bow lake
