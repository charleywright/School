## Rivers
#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* Steep slopes in the upper course give the river a lot of energy
* The river erodes due to hydraulic action and abrasion.
	* Hydraulic action
	* Abrasion
* The valley sides are exposed to weatrhering such as freeze-thaw and biological weathering
* Material from weathering rolls down the valley sides into the river due to gravity
* It is carried by the river downstream as bedload, aiding the process of abrasion

#### Formation of waterfall


#### Formation of meander


#### Formation of ox-bow lake
