## Rivers
#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* River flows downhill quickly with lots of energy and erodes the landscape vertically due to steep slopes
* The river cuts a deep gash into the landscape using hydraulic action, abrasion and corrosion.
* As the river erodes, the walls are exposed to freeze-thaw weathering, which loosens rocks and causes them to fall into the river. This helps steepen valley sides.
* The fallen rocks help with abrasion, leading to futher erosion
* The river transports the rocks downstream. The process of attrition breaks up the rocks and rounds them as the move downstream
* The river channel becomes wider and deeper as it continues to erode soft rock
* Hard rock erodes much slower, so the river goes around areas of hard rock, forming interlocking spurs

#### Formation of waterfall


#### Formation of meander


#### Formation of ox-bow lake
