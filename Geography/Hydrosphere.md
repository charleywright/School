## Rivers
#### Erosion (Common between all)
**Hydraulic Action** - Water forces air into cracks in the rock which exherts pressure on the rock, causing it to crack and break away. The physical force of the water alone can also be enough to weaken and break away rock
**Abrasion** - Rock in the water hits and grinds against the banks/riverbed, acting like sandpaper to erode the rock
**Solution** - Water dissolves some of the minerals in rocks, weathering them

#### Formation of V-shaped valley
* Steep slopes in the upper course give the river a lot of energy
* The river erodes due to hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN).
* The valley sides are exposed to weatrhering such as freeze-thaw and biological weathering
* Material from weathering rolls down the valley sides into the river due to gravity
* It is carried by the river downstream as bedload, aiding the process of abrasion

#### Formation of waterfall
* Formed when a river flows over bands of soft and hard rock
* Softer, less resistant rock is eroded faster by the processes of hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN)
* The river undercuts the hard rock, creating an unsupported overhang
* The river continues to erode below the overhand, cutting further inward and deepening the river in that area, creating a plunge pool
* The unsupported overhang eventually collapses into the plung pool where it is broken up and used in abrasion for further erosion
* Some rock will continue downstream as bedload
* This cycle continues, with the waterfall slowly moving upstream, cutting a gorge into the landscape

#### Formation of meander
* Formed where rivers lose power and begin eroding laterally in the middle course
* They do this through abtrasion and hydraulic action
* Erosion is greatest on the outide of the river bends as this is where the flow of water is the fastest
* As water hits the outside of the bend it is forced under and along the riverbed to the opposite side of the river. This forms a spiral and is called helicoidal flow
* This causes a steep river cliff to form on the outside of the bend and a river beach on the inside
* The river beach is made up of materials that the river has been carrying that have been deposited due to the inside of a bend having much slower flow rate and less energy

#### Formation of ox-bow lake
* Ox-bow lakes form in the lower course of a river where flood plain sediment is reworked through lateral erosion, causing the shape and path of that stretch of river to be ever-changing
* They are formed where a pre-existing 
* Erosive processes include hydraulic action and abrasion (EXPLAIN)
