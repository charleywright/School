Land use conflict in a glaciated area

## Walkers and deer stalking
##### Conflict
Careless/ignorant walkers can walk into a place where a stalk is taking place, scaring deer away forcing an end to the stalk. There is also a risk of walkers being int he way of a shot

##### Management
Education through signs ans social media is important in helping visitors understand what stalking is and what to avoid. Estates worked together to set up the Hill Phone Network to allow walkers to call to find where is safe to walk and where to avoid

##### Evaluation
Social media has been effective in increasing understanding surrounding stalking, however the Hill Phone Network has been abandoned as little use was made and estates did not always answer or couldn't provide the requested information

## Deer and woodland expansion
##### Conflict
Estates want to keep deer numbers high to increase their value and provide animals for stalking. High deer numbers prevent forest regeneration as deer eat young trees, thrashing them to remove velvet from their antlers and destroying them

##### Management
Deer numbers can be removed through culling. Deer numbers are controlled through Deer Management Groups which bring local estates together with government advisors. These aim to reach agreement over deer numbers through discussion and compromise. The National Park also develops its own policy on deer management (the Deer Framework for the Cairngorms National Park)
