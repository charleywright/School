Land use conflict in a glaciated area

## Walkers and deer stalking
##### Conflict
Careless/ignorant walkers can walk into a place where a stalk is taking place, scaring deer away forcing an end to the stalk. There is also a risk of walkers being int he way of a shot

##### Management
Education through signs ans social media is important in helping visitors understand what stalking is and what to avoid. Estates worked together to set up the Hill Phone Network to allow walkers to call to find where is safe to walk and where to avoid

##### Evaluation
Social media has been effective in increasing understanding surrounding stalking, however the Hill Phone Network has been abandoned as little use was made and estates did not always answer or couldn't provide the requested information

## Deer and woodland expansion
##### Conflict
Estates want to keep deer numbers high to increase

## Dog owners and Capercaillie

## Housing development and conservation

## Camper vans and locals
