Land use conflict in a glaciated area

## Walkers and deer stalking
##### Conflict
Careless/ignorant walkers can walk into a place where a stalk is taking place, scaring deer away forcing an end to the stalk. There is also a risk of walkers being int he way of a shot

##### Management
Education through signs ans social media is important in helping visitors understand what stalking is and what to avoid. Estates worked together to set up the Hill Phone Network to allow walkers to call to find where is safe to walk and where to avoid

##### Effectiveness
Social media has been effective in increasing understanding surrounding stalking, however the Hill Phone Network has been abandoned as little use was made and estates did not always answer or couldn't provide the requested information

## Deer and woodland expansion
##### Conflict
Estates want to keep deer numbers high to increase their value and provide animals for stalking. High deer numbers prevent forest regeneration as deer eat young trees, thrashing them to remove velvet from their antlers and destroying them

##### Management
Deer numbers can be removed through culling. Deer numbers are controlled through Deer Management Groups which bring local estates together with government advisors. These aim to reach agreement over deer numbers through discussion and compromise. The National Park also develops its own policy on deer management (the Deer Framework for the Cairngorms National Park)

##### Effectiveness
Managing deer numbers is still a cause of conflict in the Park. The Park has included ambitious targets t encourage woodland regeneration by decreasing deer numbers to help climate change and many estates and estate workers disagree with this

## Dog owners and Capercaillie
##### Conflict
Capercaillie are under threat in Scotland with only 1200 individuals and 80% of them in the National Park. They are dying due to colliding with deer dences, disturbance bypeple and uncontrolled dogs killing chicks and adults

##### Management
The CNPA (Cairngorms National Park Authority) funds a ranger service to engage wih dog owners and encourage them to behave responsibly. The CNPA advises land owners on how to help capercaillie. They have created a Core Paths Plan to encourage the public to avoid key areas during the breeding season.

##### Effectiveness
Capercaillie numbers are still declining and so success has been limited. The increasing populatiry of the Park has meant more and more people using the forests where birds live. New housing has also meant that key capercaillie areas are used more often. Ranger services have helped but they can only do so much to help

## Housing development and conservation
##### Conflict
As increasing numbers of houses are being built in the National Park the land available for the habitat of species such as capercaillie, wild cats, pine martins etc are reduced. Due to the popularity of living in the Park, house prices are very high and local young people can't afford them. Many new houses are bought as holiday homes therefore aren't available as housing. People holidaying in these houses do not contribute to the local economy and community in the same way someone living there would (they do not support local businesses, instead using supermarkets and bringing items they need). New housing estates have a negative impact on the landscape of the National Park e.g Upper Burnside, Aviemore.

##### Management
The national park attempts to provide a suitable amount of housing within new developments. The National Planning Board attemps to promote good environmetal standards within housing developments. The National Park attempts to ensure suitable housing it built in suitable areas by creating local Development Plans, which weighs up housing needs and try to allocate new houses to suitable areas.

##### Effectiveness
In Boat of Garten a planneed development of 72 houses was scaled down to 32 houses in response to concerns over environmental impact. After local consultation and a seasonal ranger was employed to monitor dog walker behaviour and some extra areas were planted up to reduce impact on local wildlife.

## Camper vans and locals
