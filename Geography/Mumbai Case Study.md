## Dharavi
##### Problem
* Land is not legally owned
	* Could be knocked down at any moment
		* Little incentive to develop and renovate
* Little to no ammenities
	* waste disposal
	* clean water
	* sewage network
* Hand built with scavenged materials
	* No building regulations
		* Buildings can be dangerous and unsteady
* Water is shared and can run beside open sewers
* Very small and overcrowded (7 people could be in one room)
* Disease is common and spreads quick due to lack of healthcare
* Higher crime rate

##### Solutions
**Dharavi Redevelopment Project**
* Bulldoze existing slums
* 65% total land used for rehousing, not enough to rehouse everyone
* 35% sold for commercial development
* Each house just over 200sqft, much smaller than existing dwellings
* More open space with terraced areas & specific market areas
* Private firms want to build shopping malls and hotels
* Some people give consent, most don't but could have their dwellings demolished for being illegal

**URBZ**
* Setup by professionals in design, architecture, economy etc
* Belief that residents know what they want and their feedback is crucial/should be a core part of planning & development
* Run workshops where communities take part in planning & building
* Other events aimed to bring together the community

**General**
* Give property rights, allowing people to receive loans and provide incentive to improve
* Provide ammeneties in slums making them less polluted, cleaner & more sanitary
* Build areas for rubbish collection, running water & clean toilets

##### Evaluation
* Demolition is met with protest & violence as people don't want their homes knocked down
* Only 30% of dwellers qualify, 70% would have to set up in another slum

## Mumbai Traffic (NOT NEEDED FOR PRELIM)
#### Challenges
* Two highways into the CBD
* 20 million people
* 1.8 million cars, many old and inefficient
* increasing by 200 cars per day as people earn more
* trains at 2.5X capacity
* 11 million people use public transport
* 16km/h average speed (pollution)
* $500 million lost per year in productivity and fuel
* 63 million traffic violations in 2021, 50 million in 2020 & 2019
* narrow roads, no drainage, heavy rain, poor maintenance

#### Solutions
*  MonoRail
	* Faster than cars or busses
	* Tight corners or steep terrain is not a problem
	* Easy to implement
	* Caters well to crowded and narrow areas such as the East of the city
	* Improves connectivity between railway lines
	* Only 360 passengers per train
