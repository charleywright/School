## Forced Migration (Afghanistan to Pakistan)
##### Push & pull factors
* Ongoing conflict and war that has been ongoing for many decades
* Specific sexual orientations are descriminated against & thread on their lives
* Previous government was overthrown by terrorist organization (the Taliban) who are not trusted by the population
* Other countries do not accept a terrorit organization as a government therefore won't talk or trade causing shortages
* Many rights for women have been revoked by the Taliban such as a right to education
* Basic services can be very difficult to access such as vaccines for children
* Damages to infrastructure & transport cause issues with getting to work and jobs, causing  unemployment

##### Impact on donor country (Afghanistan)
* People leaving decrease the number of farmers, leading to food shortages
* Educated people left (e.g doctors & teachers) causing staffing issues in healthcare and education
	* Worse education to remaining people making it harder to recover and worse healthcare especially for children and poor communities
* Little funding for law enforcement -> More corruption as people are more likely to accept money
	* Decreased safety as the Taliban have a foothold in law enforcement allowing them little pushback
* Public services such as roads are less maintained, deterioating quickly and less effective public transport
* Travel becomes dangerous and expensive, affecting commuters and causing further disruption to jobs
* basic healthcare is not available for children, which is worse in rural areas

##### Impact on receiving country (Pakistan)
* so many new people with not enough jobs for everyone as development hasn't caught up yet
* housing has the same problem, lots of new people with development lagging behind
* people spending their entire time in pakistan in refugee camps as there is nowhere for them to go
* lots of regugees are very dependant on the government for support which is very expensive straining the country
* large number of nregistered illegal refugees (1.5million registered, 1million unregistered) causing tracking population to be very difficult. Lack of citizenship for a lot of people means they cannot legally work
* illegal migrants do not want to return to afghanistan and will resort to violence, putting strain on authorities
* Pakistan have had to stop granting refugee status as there are too many people
* pressure on healthcare, education, housing & jobs caused the government to put restrictions on who can access these resources & services

## Voluntary Migration (Poland to the UK)
##### Push & pull factors
* Poland has a high unemployment rate (18.5% in 2005) compared to the UK
* Rural areas have as high as 40% unemployment
* approximately 40% of young people are unemployed, forcing them to remain with their parents
* increased number of available jobs in the UK compared to Poland
* The UK has a much lower unemployment rate of around 5% with better wages which could help with mentality and living standards
* Higher GDP of 30k in UK compared to 13k in Poland - More high paying jobs in the UK
* 600,000 vacancies for semi-skilled and skilled jobs in 2007 rewarding educated people
* One of only 3 countries that did not limit the number of allowed refugees (easier to be accepted; less friction)
* lack of healthcare in Poland with less advanced technology. People requiring complex medical procedures may migrate for these proceduces and better treatment
* People in rural areas ma be subsistent farmers, UK could allow them to make more and better support their families
* Many polish people know english already, decreased friction because a new language doesn't have to be learned

##### Impact on donor country (Poland)
* People emigrating decreases the population therefore decreases stress on resources like food & water and causes more jobs to come available
* people may go to the UK to learn a skill then return to Poland with their new skill, benefiting the Polish economy
* people may emigrate to the UK and send money back home. The pound is considered a "hard currency" meaning it does not fluctuate over short periods of time
	* people in Poland have more money to spend, benefiting the economy
* reduced population growth due to large proportion of emigrants being young men decreasing birth rate
* large number of young, educated, skilled workers leaving slowing development
* more jobs become available so older population have to fill in the gaps & people working difficult jobs decreases efficiency, hurting the economy
* young men are prime candidates to defend Poland in the event of conflict. with them leaving there are less people left to defend the country if needed
* people in Poland may compare the country to the UK, putting strain on the government to improve to the same standards of the UK

##### Impact on receiving country (The UK)
* some migrants are willing to do jobs that citizens to not want such as low-paid jobs in factories, cayering, cleaning and labouring
	* unskilled jobs, very suitable for people with lower levels of education or who are waiting on qualifications to transfer (may need to prove their skils as qualifications may not transfer)
	* some are willing to work long hours in unsociable settings
* influx of young people has helped the UK cope with having an ageing population by increasing the number of young people working, benefiting the economy and government
	* more taxes paid, help support older population
