## Forced Migration (Afghanistan to Pakistan)
##### Push & pull factors
* Ongoing conflict and war that has been ongoing for many decades
* Specific sexual orientations are descriminated against & thread on their lives
* Previous government was overthrown by terrorist organization (the Taliban) who are not trusted by the population
* Other countries do not accept a terrorit organization as a government therefore won't talk or trade causing shortages
* Many rights for women have been revoked by the Taliban such as a right to education
* Basic services can be very difficult to access such as vaccines for children
* Damages to infrastructure & transport cause issues with getting to work and jobs, causing  unemployment

##### Impact on donor country (Afghanistan)
* People leaving decrease the number of farmers, leading to food shortages
* Educated people left (e.g doctors & teachers) causing staffing issues in healthcare and education
	* Worse education to remaining people making it harder to recover and worse healthcare especially for children and poor communities
* Little funding for law enforcement -> More corruption as people are more likely to accept money
	* Decreased safety as the Taliban have a foothold in law enforcement allowing them little pushback
