## Forced Migration (Afghanistan to Pakistan)
##### Push & pull factors
* Ongoing conflict and war that has been ongoing for many decades
* Specific sexual orientations are descriminated against & thread on their lives
* Previous government was overthrown by terrorist organization (the Taliban) who are not trusted by the population
* Other countries do not accept a terrorit organization as a government therefore won't talk or trade causing shortages
* Many rights for women have been revoked by the Taliban such as a right to education
* Basic services can be very difficult to access such as vaccines for children
* Damages to infrastructure & transport cause issues with getting to work and jobs, causing  unemployment

##### Impact on donor country (Afghanistan)
* People leaving decrease the number of farmers, leading to food shortages
* Educated people left (e.g doctors & teachers) causing staffing issues in healthcare and education
	* Worse education to remaining people making it harder to recover and worse healthcare especially for children and poor communities
* Little funding for law enforcement -> More corruption as people are more likely to accept money
	* Decreased safety as the Taliban have a foothold in law enforcement allowing them little pushback
* Public services such as roads are less maintained, deterioating quickly and less effective public transport
* Travel becomes dangerous and expensive, affecting commuters and causing further disruption to jobs
* basic healthcare is not available for children, which is worse in rural areas

##### Impact on receiving country (Pakistan)
* so many new people with not enough jobs for everyone as development hasn't caught up yet
* housing has the same problem, lots of new people with development lagging behind
* people spending their entire time in pakistan in refugee camps as there is nowhere for them to go
* lots of regugees are very dependant on the government for support which is very expensive straining the country
* large number of nregistered illegal refugees (1.5million registered, 1million unregistered) causing tracking population to be very difficult. Lack of citizenship for a lot of people means they cannot legally work
* illegal migrants do not want to return to afghanistan and will resort to violence, putting strain on authorities
* Pakistan have had to stop granting refugee status as there are too many people
* pressure on healthcare, education, housing & jobs caused the government to put restrictions on who can access these resources & services

## Voluntary Migration (Poland to the UK)
##### Push & pull factors
* Poland has a high unemployment rate (18.5% in 2005) compared to the UK
* Rural areas have as high as 40% unemployment
* approximately 40% of young people are unemployed, forcing them to remain with their parents
* increased number of available jobs in the UK compared to Poland
* The UK has a much lower unemployment rate of around 5% with better wages which could help with mentality and living standards
* Higher GDP of 30k in UK compared to 13k in Poland - More high paying jobs in the UK
* 600,000 vacancies for semi-skilled and skilled jobs in 2007 rewarding educated people
* One of only 3 countries that did not limit the number of allowed refugees (easier to be accepted; less friction)
* lack of healthcare in Poland with less advanced technology. People requiring complex medical procedures may migrate for these proceduces and better treatment
* People in rural areas ma be subsistent farmers, UK could allow them to make more and better support their families
* Many polish people know english already, decreased friction because a new language doesn't have to be k
