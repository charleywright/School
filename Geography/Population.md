## Gathering Data
##### Census
* Carried out every 10 years
* Each householder completes a detailed survey about everyone in their household
* Questions about social, economic & cultural background

##### Civil Registration
* Record of all births, marriages and deaths
* Must be registered by law
* Allows updates between censuses
* Allows population monitoring at local, regional & national level

##### Scottish Household Survey
* Continous survey, constantly evolving
* Based on a random sample of the population
* Cheaper than a full census

## Data inaccuracies
* The sheer size of some countries makes the collection of data very difficult (in terms of area and population) e.g India
* Mountainous areas are difficult to reach gor govt/ officials e.g Afghanistan
* Births and deaths are not always registered so it is difficult to know how many people are meant to be in an area
* Migration can be a huge problem making it difficult to keep track of people e.g Syria
* Many languages are spoken in some countries meaning forms need to be translated
