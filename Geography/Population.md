## Gathering Data
##### Census
* Carried out every 10 years
* Each householder completes a detailed survey about everyone in their household
* Questions about social, economic & cultural background

##### Civil Registration
* Record of all births, marriages and deaths
* Must be registered by law
* Allows updates between censuses
* Allows population monitoring at local, regional & national level

##### Scottish Household Survey
* Continous survey, constantly evolving
* Based on a random sample of the population
* Cheaper than a full census

## Data inaccuracies
* The sheer size of some countries makes the collection of data very difficult (in terms of area and population) e.g India
* Mountainous areas are difficult to reach gor govt/ officials e.g Afghanistan
* Births and deaths are not always registered so it is difficult to know how many people are meant to be in an area
* Migration can be a huge problem making it difficult to keep track of people e.g Syria
* Many languages are spoken in some countries meaning forms need to be translated, costing money and increasing difficulty
* The cost of producing a mass census means that developing countries cannot afford to do it very often e.g a lot of the poorer developing countries in Africa
* There is an ongoing civil war in Syria, so any government operation would be a target. The amount of violence would make collecting data very dangerous potentially with casulties
* In Chad only 22% of people can read and write, meaning most people would not be able to compete a written census without aid which would be very expensive

## Describe/Explain Population Pyramids
![Bangladesh Pyramid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleywright/School/master/Geography/Bangladesh%20Pyramid.png)
##### Wide base showing high  proportion of young dependants
High birth rates:
* Lack of family planning
* High infant mortality (people have more children to compensate)
* Need for workers in agriculture (family farms)
* Religion (e.g many boys to show a strong family)
* Children to support adults when they're older

##### Narrows quickly, indicating a decreasing working population
High death rates
* High levels of disease
* Famine
* Lack of clean water and bad sanitation
* Lack of or poor access to healthcare
* Lack of education (hygeine and basic anatomy)
* War/conflict causing large numbers of casualties

##### Tapers rapidly towards the top indicating a low proportion of elderly dependants
High death rates and low life expectancy
 * Malnutrition
 * Overcrowding
 * Poor geriatric healthcare
 * Inadequate welfare systems

![Italy 2050 Pyramid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleywright/School/master/Geography/Italy%202050%20Pyramid.png)
##### Narrow base indicating a low proportion of young dependants
Low/falling birth rates
* Increased family planning
* Increased availability of contraception
* Lower infant mortaliry rates
* Increased use of robots reduces the need for workers
* Increased standard of living
* Chaning status of women (push for education/careers)

##### Fairly uniform with filled out sides indicating high proportion of working population
Low death rates
* Accessible and widespread healthcare (e.g vaccines)
* improved hygeine (clean drinking water)
* Improved sanitation
* Imrpoved foor production and storage

##### Reasonably wide top indicating a large proportion of elderly dependants
Declining death rates and increased life expectancy
* Advances in geriatric health and community care
* State and private pensions allowing increased living standards
* Generally rising living standards
* Specialised housing e.g care homes
* Imrpoved diets causing people to be healthier

## Population Structure Consequences
#### Ageing (UK)
**Effects**
* More health/care services needed as lots of elderly cannot live independantly
* Require care if they develop illness/disease, potentially for extended periods of time
	* Price of healthcare rises, in the UK increase is put on tax payers
* Strain on working population to support the elderly
* Elderly work very little, can't help with the armed forces & don't pay much if any tax
	* Age of retirement increases as working class need to work for longer

**Solutions (increase birth rates)**
* Increase paternity leave & benefits to incentivise potential mothers to give birth
* Increase working population thus taxpayers (already happening as retirement age increases)
	* Decrease pensions to increase retirement age
* Increase number and quality of nurseries to allow parents to work
* Push for private pensions instead of public pensions
* Allow more immigrants, increasing the working population

#### Youthful (The Gambia)
**Effects**
* **Very similar to ageing population just the cause is children**
* Pressure on working population to provide for over half the population
* Spend lots of money on services e.g school, hospitals, etc
* Not enough trained professionals (e.g doctors & teachers) for all the children
* Pressure on farmers to produce more food
	* Land is farmed intensively, causing soil to deteriorate
	* Deforestation to make space for more farmland
* Not enough housing causing people to build their own which are unsafe and unregistered
	* Lack of basic ameneties such as clean water & a toilet
* Not enough jobs therefore unemployment rates are high
* Crime rates increase as people explore other avenues
* Schools and hospitals are overcrowded with not everyone having access to them

**Solutions**
* Limit on family size
	* China enforced One Child Policy in 1979 causing dramatic decrease in number of youths
* Add incentives for small families e.g free health care & preferential housing
* Better education about reproduction & families, increasing family planning
* Focus on education for women, allowing them to pursue careers and focus on themselves instead of starting a family
* Better access, knowledge & opportunity for abortions
* Improvements in farming allowing for higher yields
