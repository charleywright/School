## Problems with single indicators
* They are averages across the entire country
	* Huge differences can be hidden
	* Different areas can have very different levels of development
	* Rural/Urban differences are not represented. Rural areas tend to be poorer and have worse access to doctors
	* Countries with a large amount of raw materials e.g oil 

## Composite Indicators
Composite indicators are more accurate than single indicators because they give a more broad view of a country instead of focussing on one very small part

##### HDI (Human Development Index)
* Combination of
	* Life expectancy
	* Cost of living
	* Adult literacy rate
	* School enrollment
	* GNI per capita
* Produces a number between 0 and 1
* 0.8 and above are considered "developed"

##### PQLI (Physical Quality of Life Index)
* Combination of
	* Life expectancy
	* Infant mortality rate
	* Adult literacy rate
* Produces a number between 0 and 100
* Over 77 is considered "developed"
