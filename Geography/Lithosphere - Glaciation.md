## Corries
##### Corrie (Corrie an Lochan, Cairngorms)
* Most commonly on North/Noth-East facing slopes as more shade allows snow to build up faster
* Snow falls, compacting and pushing air out, forming ice (neve)
* Weight of the ice causes it to begin to slowly move downhill and rotate, called Rotational Slip
* Some ice may melt due to friction, producting meltwater which acts as a lubricant
* Water may enter cracks and freeze, attaching rock to the ice. Ice moves, ripping the rock away
* Rock in the ice (potentially from plucking) scrapes against the hillside, eroding it. This is abrasion
* The ice may slip away from the back wall, creating a crevasse
* After the ice melts freeze thaw (water entering cracks, freezing, exherting pressure on rock, repeating until rock breaks) can cause the walls of the corrie to steepen
* Water may fill the hollow created forming a Tarn
* The rocks from the corrie may roll down the hillside and become part of a glacier, aiding with abrasion

##### Arete (Carn Mor Dearg)
* **Most marks are from corrie formation**
* Two corries form back to back, producing an arete
* Back walls of corries may erode further, decreasing the width of the arete and making it more jagged
* Freeze-thaw may occur on the arete, making it further jagged

##### Pyramidal Peak (Angel Peak, Cairngorms)
* **Most marks are from corrie/arete formation**
* Three or more corries erode back to back around a mountain top
* Arete's formed by corries rise to a pyramidal peak
* Sharpened by freeze-thaw, further increasing it's steepness


## Valleys
##### U-Shaped Valley (Lairig Ghru, Cairngorms)
* Formed where V-shaped valley is
* More commonly on North/North-East facing slope (less sunlight allows snow to accumulate faster)
* Snow compacts, pushing out air and forming ice
* Gets too heavy, gravity causes movement downhill
* Plucking may occur (water freezing around rocks, attaching them to glacier, glacier rips them out) steepening walls of valley
* Abrasion may occur (rocks in glacier - potentially from plucking - scrape against floor) deepening and widening valley
* Follows existing v-shaped valley, interlocking spurs may be cut off forming truncated spurs & steep valley sides
* Glacier loses power due to increasing temperatures due to altitude or surrounding area
* Some material is discarded and some ice melts to allow the glacier to continue
* Glacier comes to a stop, if pushing material a terminal moraine may be formed
* Ribbon lock may form behind terminal moraine as it acts like a natural barrier/dam
* Misift stream may form (small stream down valley floor)
* Freeze-thaw (water entering cracks, freezing, exherting pressure on rock repeatedly eventually causing it to break) could continue to erode sides, making them rougher and producting scree

##### Hanging Valley
* **Most marks are from u-shaped valley**
* Formed where a glacier was in a tributary stream
* Tributary streams/valleys have much less power therefore don't erode as deep as the main valley
* After glacier retreats, tributary streams form waterfalls where they enter main valley

##### Ribbon Lake/Loch (Loch Avon, Cairngorms)
* **Most marks are yet again from u-shaped valley**
* Formed behind terminal moraine because the terminal moraine acts like a natural dam keeping the water back

## Depositional Features
**Material deposits can be**
- **Till**: Sediment carried and deposited by ice. Unsorted in size and jagged due to originating from plucking and/or freeze-thaw
- **Fluvioglacial(Meltwater) Deposits**: Sediment deposited by meltwater stream. Sorted by size as heavier material is deposited first, often in layers (stratified). Rocks are rounded, with rounded gravel and sand too due to attrition (rocks hitting eachother and rounding eachother)

#### Terminal Moraine
* Barrier formed from one side to the other across a u-shaped valley floor marking the furthest point a glacier reached
* Made of unsorted material as it was being pushed by the glacier before being deposited
* Material is rough and jagged as it came from plucking/freeze-thaw and was carried by the glacier
* The glacier lost energy due to ice melting caused by increasing temperatures. These are due to altitude decreasing and/or the surrounding area warming up
* It may act as a natural dam, causing a ribbon lake to form behind it

#### Drumlin
* Formed from material dumped by a glacier therefore rough, jagged from plucking & freeze-thaw
* Commonly formed on top of a pre-existing obstacle as it acts like a trigger point and material builds up around it 
* Glacier becomes overloaded with material and must deposit some similar to how a river deposits material
* The glacier often becomes overloaded due to temperatures increasing causing ice to melt. Could be because of temperatures increasing as altitude decreases and/or surrounding area warming up
* Steep side called Stoss facing upstream, Gentle side called Lee facing downstream, indicating the direction the glacier was travelling
* Elongated mound as material was deposited then glacier continued moving, dragging out the material forming Lee slope
* Often found in swarms / in a "basket of eggs" topography

#### Esker
* Found after a glacier as material has been carried by a metlwater (fluvioglacial) stream
* Long winding snake-like ridge of material along valley floor
* Formed where a meltwater (fulvioglacial) stream existed inside the glacier
* The material is sorted as the heaviest material was deposited first
* Rocks hit together and rounded eachother, called attrition
* Further rounding occurs due to large rocks rolling along riverbed (Traction)
