## Brown Earth
![Brown Earth Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleywright/School/master/Geography/Brown%20Earth%20Diagram.png)
* Deciduous vegetation
* Deep leaf litter (from deciduous trees) and fermentation layer above humus
	* Decomposition and fermentation occurs quickly due to mild climate
* Thick and fertile Ao horizon with well-mixed layers. Dark in colour. Mull (slightly acidic humus layer)
	* Well mixed due to large number of organisgms present
* Dark brown A horizon enriched with nutrients. Loamy texture
	* Mixed with humus layer because soil biota. Well aerated as a result
* Lighter brown B horizon with long roots to reach minerals
* Slight iron pan could form
	* Some leaching occurs if precipication is greater than evaporation but this is a gradual process
* Deepest tree roots can reach into C horizon to find nutrients as the soil is so well mixed
* Good drainage due to deep roots
* Mild climate with balanced precipitation and evaporation
* Horizons are not clearly defined due to long roots, some leaching and large number of biota
