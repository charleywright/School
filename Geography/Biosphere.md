## Brown Earth
![Brown Earth Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleywright/School/master/Geography/Brown%20Earth%20Diagram.png)
* Deciduous vegetation
* Deep leaf litter (from deciduous trees) and fermentation layer above humus
	* Decomposition and fermentation occurs quickly due to mild climate
* Thick and fertile Ao horizon with well-mixed layers. Dark in colour. Mull (slightly acidic humus layer)
	* Well mixed due to large number of organisgms present
* Dark brown A horizon enriched with nutrients. Loamy texture
	* Mixed with humus layer because soil biota. Well aerated as a result
* Lighter brown B horizon with long roots to reach minerals
* Slight iron pan could form
	* Some leaching occurs if precipication is greater than evaporation but this is a gradual process\
* Deepest tree roots can reach into C horizon to find nutrients as the soil is so well mixed
* Good drainage due to deep roots
* Mild climate with balanced precipitation and evaporation
* Horizons are not clearly defined due to long roots, some leaching and large number of biota

## Podsol
![Podsol Diagram](https://github.com/charleywright/School/blob/master/Geography/Podsol%20Diagram.png)
* coniferous forest with shallow roots reaching into A layer
* Leaf litter made up of decaying needles, cones and other waxy vegetation
* Shallow acidic mor humus layer with leaf litter & fermentation
	* Thin due to lack of decomposition (very slow) due to low temperatures and lack of organisms
* Grey sandy/gritty eluviated A horizon
	* Higher precipitation thatn evaporation causes leaching, iron and minerals are washed into B layer
* Reddish brown B horizon
	* Minerals and iron are illuviated into this later, giving rusty red/brown color
* Iron pan may frm lower in the profile causing drainage issues
* Can have waterlogged soil
* Snow melt can cause further drainage issues
* Found on steep slopes which further increases leaching with shallow roots not reaching leached minerals
* Limited biota due to low temperature, high precipication, tough leaf litter & eluviated minerals

## Gley
![Gley Diagram](https://github.com/charleywright/School/blob/master/Geography/Gley%20Diagram.png)
* Wet loving species like reeds, moss, lichens
* Three well defined layers in Ao horizon: Leaf litter, fermentation layer, peaty acidic mor humus
* Dark greyish brown silty A horizon. Some red-brown mottling along root channels
	* Lack of access to oxygen because of waterlogging, so oxygen is taken from iron compounds creating grey/blue/green color
* Sticky clay-like waterlogged blue-grey B horizon with some pockets of red mottling
* Few biota due to anaerobic conditions
	* Caused by lack of drainage and high precipitation
* Found on valley floors
	* Water drains into this soil, increasing waterlogging
* Precipitation is much greater than evaporation due to location and lack of drainage
* C horizon is impermeable clay/permafrost
