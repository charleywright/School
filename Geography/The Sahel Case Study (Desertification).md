**The Sahel**
* Belt spanning Africa just south of the Sahara desert
* Roughly 5400km long
* Covers about 3 million $km^2$
* 200 to 600mm of rainfall annually in only 1 or 2 months per year
* Vegetation consists of mainly grass and shrubs
* Semi-nomadic herding tradition of life

## Causes
* Insufficient rainfall
	* Low crop production
	* Drop in tree cover
* Sudden heavy rain
* Population growth (one of the highest in the world)
* Overgrasing/deforestation
* Soil forms very slowly (500 to 1000 years to form one inch of topsoil)
* 65% of land in Africa lost to degradation

## Impacts
* Crop degradation
	* Crop failure
		* Under nurished people
		* Starvation
* Badly affected countries lose a significant amount of land (Mauritania only has 200km wide strip)
* Disease and illness spread causing people to not be able to work
	* People don't have money and cannot afford healthcare
		* Cycle of poverty develops
* People move from country side into the city to find food but often can't afford it so end up in shanty towns on the edge of the city
* Lack of food and water for animals threatens traditional nomad life
* Settlements develop because people want to find food and jobs
	* Settlements put increased stress on the surrounding land (over-cultivation)
		* Less biodiversity, loss of soil structure, increased erosion, nutrient depletion)
* Food prices increase due to higher demand and lower availability
* Soil erosion decreases soil fertility, creating a downwards cycle
* Lack of clean water allows diseases such as Cholera to spread
* Rivers and water holes dry up, causing organisms and wildlife that depend on them to die (potentially entire species too)
* Vegetation dies, causing wildlife to die and potentially their species
* Eroded material is washed/blown into water supplies, contaminating them
* In the last 30 years, nomads went from 70% to 7%

## Solutions/Effectiveness
##### Movable fencing/Managed grazing pens (restrict grazing to managed areas)
 + Reduces dangers of over grazing and trampling soil
 + Allows time for soil and land to recover between grazing sessions

- Only successful if fencing is available and affordable
- Herders must reach agreement which is not always possible
- Settlement of Korr in Kenya, woody thorn material was harvested which left no food for the animals of other herders (Deforestation of surrounding area/woodland)

##### Contour ploughing (plough along contours of hillside)
+ Slows runoff during rainstorms
	+ Decreases soil erosion
	+ Allows water to soak into the soil

*  Slows down irrigation, allowing water to soak into the soil and the soil remain moist

- Works well for moderate slopes (<10%) reducing soil erosion by up to 50%
- If the contour lines are misidentified it can increase erosion

##### Magic stones (stones placed along contours)
+ Allow water to seep into the soil instead of running off
+ Decrease erosion by catching soil
+ Can double the yield of crops such as grandnuts

* Very low cost
* Can be raked over land, also brings buried nutrients to the top
* In Mali they have increased crop yields by up to 50%

##### Irrigation (artitifical watering of crops using stored water)
+ Keeps soil moist
+ Denser and heavier soil is less suceptible to erosion and being blown away

- Only successful if water is able to be stored
- Overuse can decrease quality of soil

##### Planting pits (Dig hole, surround with dirt, add manure or compost. Termites are attracted and dig galleries in the soil which soak in water and better retain it)
