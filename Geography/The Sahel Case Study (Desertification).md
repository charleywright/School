* Covers about 3 million $km^2$
* 200 to 600mm of rainfall annually in only 1 or 2 months per year

* Semi-nomadic herding tradition of life

## Causes
* Insufficient rainfall
	* Low crop production
	* Drop in tree cover
* Sudden heavy rain
* Population growth (one of the highest in the world)
* Overgrasing/deforestation
* Soil forms very slowly (500 to 1000 years to form one inch of topsoil)
* 65% of land in Africa lost to degradation

## Impacts
* Crop degradation
	* Crop failure
		* Under nurished people
		* Starvation
* Badly affected countries lose
