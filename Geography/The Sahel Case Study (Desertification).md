**The Sahel**
* Belt spanning Africa just south of the Sahara desert
* Roughly 5400km long
* Covers about 3 million $km^2$
* 200 to 600mm of rainfall annually in only 1 or 2 months per year
* Vegetation consists of mainly grass and shrubs
* Semi-nomadic herding tradition of life

## Causes
* Insufficient rainfall
	* Low crop production
	* Drop in tree cover
* Sudden heavy rain
* Population growth (one of the highest in the world)
* Overgrasing/deforestation
* Soil forms very slowly (500 to 1000 years to form one inch of topsoil)
* 65% of land in Africa lost to degradation

## Impacts
* Crop degradation
	* Crop failure
		* Under nurished people
		* Starvation
* Badly affected countries lose a significant amount of land (Mauritania only has 200km wide strip)
* Disease and illness spread causing people to not be able to work
	* People don't have money and cannot afford healthcare
		* Cycle of poverty develops
* People move from country side into the city to find food but often can't afford it so end up in shanty towns on the edge of the city
* Lack of food and water for animals threatens traditional nomad life
* Settlements develop because people want to find food
