## Unit 1 (Chemical changes and structure)
* In the periodic table, the strongest reducing agents are in group 1, and the strongest oxidising agents are in group 7
* hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent
* carbon monoxide is a reducing agent
* oxidising agents can kill bacteria & act as bleach to remove colour

## Unit 2 (Nature's chemistry)
TODO

## Unit 3 (Chemistry in society)
##### Factors for industrial process design
* Availability, sustainability & cost of reactants
* Opportunities for recycling
* Energy use
* How useful are the bi-products (can they be sold)
* Product yield

##### Environment considerations for industrial process design
* Minimising waste
* Avoiding using or producing toxic chemicals
* Designing bio-degradeable products
