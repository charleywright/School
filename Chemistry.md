## Unit 1 (Chemical changes and structure)
* In the periodic table, the strongest reducing agents are in group 1, and the strongest oxidising agents are in group 7
* hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising agent
* carbon monoxide is a reducing agent
* oxidising agents can kill bacteria & act as bleach to remove colour

##### Redox balancing
1. Balance the non-oxygen element
2. Balance oxygens with water
3. Balance hydrogens with $H+$ ions
4. Equalise the charges with $e^-$

#### Bonding, solubility, etc
* Bonding in elements is a scale from ionic through polar covalent to non-polar covalent
* Non-polar covalent molecules may contain polar bonds however if the molecule is symmetrical (linear or tetrahedral) the dipoles cancel out, leaving the molecule non-polar
* Elements with a high electronegativity bonded to hydrogen e.g N, O, F form molecules that can have permanent dipole-dipole forces. 

## Unit 2 (Nature's chemistry)
TODO

## Unit 3 (Chemistry in society)
##### Factors for industrial process design
* Availability, sustainability & cost of reactants
* Opportunities for recycling
* Energy use
* How useful are the bi-products (can they be sold)
* Product yield

##### Environment considerations for industrial process design
* Minimising waste
* Avoiding using or producing toxic chemicals
* Designing bio-degradeable products

##### Rates of reaction
* If the rate of reaction is too slow it is very expensive, if it is too high there is a risk of explosion
