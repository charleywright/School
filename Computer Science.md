## Development methodologies
#### Iterative Development
* Break down large problems into smaller parts
* Assign small chunks to individual developers
* Design, Develop, Test, Repeat

#### Agile methodologies
1.  Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3.  Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11.  Best [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Architecture "Agile Architecture"), requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
